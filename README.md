# Arielle-Pavor-Nocturnus-pitch

In Pavor Nocturnus, the kid (who shall not be gendered) must face recurring night terrors. You must help them journey through the chaos that is their room while battaling evil minions and the things that go BUMP in the night to help reunite them with teddy, so they can wake up from this nightmare! This is a story book tale with many levels, including future concepts "Dark Forest, No Strings Attached  (aka, The Jack in the Box), Grandfather Clock, and the Thing in the Lake." This project, Creature Under the Bed, will start with kid turning out the lights and making their way to his source of safety--their beloved teddy. Can you do it? Can you reunite them before their nightmarish imagination gets the better of them?

# Arielle-Pavor-Nocturnus-pitch

In Pavor Nocturnus, the boy (he who shall be named eventually) must face his recurring night terrors. You must help him journey through the chaos that is his room while battaling evil minions and the things that go BUMP in the night to help reunite him with his teddy, so he can wake up from this nightmare! This is a story book tale with many levels, including Dark Forest, No Strings Attached  (aka, The Jack in the Box), Grandfather Clock, and the Thing in the Lake. This project, Creature Under the Bed, will start with boy turning out the lights and making his way to his source of safety--his beloved teddy. Can you do it? Can you reunite them before his imagination gets the better of him?
